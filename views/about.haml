  I am a software engineer (EIT) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I enjoy all kinds of programming, except assembly, which is the bane of my existence. More information about me can be seen at my "professional online presence":http://www.darkhax.com

  I work for "CodeBaby":http://www.codebaby.com

  I designed the theme for, and built this blog from scratch. On a MacBook Pro. There was no app for that. The code, however, is all on "Github":http://github.com/darkhelmet/darkblog/tree/master
  
  This site is proudly running on "Heroku":http://heroku.com
